How did array methods like push() and filter() help you manipulate data in this activity?
Was able to add and retract things from array
What challenges did you face when trying to filter and search for items in the array?
Web3 documentation on using filter was not good. But MDN showed a clear example on how to utilize the function. I still find it a bit tricky though.
How would you modify this code to make it more efficient or user-friendly?
Maybe refactor in a way that there is less repetition within my code.
